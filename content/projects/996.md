Contentful, the system you mentioned, is tried and true. We especially like it for enterprise projects that need advanced user management. But our go-to system is actually Prismic, mainly because itâ€™s got a feature called Slices which is very powerful when it comes to creating building blocks for webpages. Using slices lets content writers compose pages with reusable components and offers greater flexibility than fixed templates.
